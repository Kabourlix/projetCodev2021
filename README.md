Abstract : 
Studying the dynamics of ecosystems is a key in the purpose of understanding the mechanisms of climatechange. In particular, behaviors of top predators, such as seabirds, give highly relevant data about the overallhealth of a given marine ecosystem. IA, and particularly Imitation Learning, play a growing role in simulatingthe decisions of such species. Yet some of these solutions, like IRL (citation), encounter problems of size,hence a need for more efficient algorithms. In this work, we propose the use of Behavioral Cloning in order tosimulate trajectories of seabirds, basing ourselves on a Markov Decision Process. Either with linear or LSTMlayers, our results are far from relevant, as our networks are very sensible and not complex enough. However,plugging them to a Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning algorithm could be an efficient way to improvethe quality of our simulations. Still, the greater margin of improvement remains the way of modeling our statesand actions within the Markov Decision Process.
